### Exercise 1

1. **Illegal identifiers**

   ```java
   int 3b = 0;
   ```

2. **Illegal numbers**

   ```java
   int a = 0x3q
   ```

   

### Exercise 2

1.  `s` itself is both a prefix and a suffix of `s`, so `x = s`.

2. It depends on `s`, for example, is `s = "aabcaa"` , then `y = "aa"` is acceptable, but if `s = "abc"`, then there is no `t` that can be both  a prefix and a suffix of `s`. Thus, whether `y` exists isn't guaranteed.



### Exercise 3

1. Substrings of length $m$ are equivalent to removing $n - m$ characters of string `s`. As we can remove consecutive characters in both sides, there are $n - m + 1$ choices. So the number of substrings is $n - m + 1$.

2. Consider each character in the string as a binary digit ($1$ means selected and $0$ not), then each binary numbers represents a subsequence. Thus, the total count of subsequences are the number of `n` digits binary number $2^n$.

   

### Exercise 4

1. ```
   digit -> [0-9]
   non_zero -> [1-9]
   country -> 86
   area -> 755
   hyphen -> -
   valid_telephone_number -> country hyphen area hyphen non_zero digit{7}
   ```

2. ```
   valid_telephone_number = 86-755-[1-9][0-9]{7}
   ```



### Exercise 5

- $L_1 \subseteq L_2$

  Each unit of any strings expressed by $0^*1^*$ is $0$ or $1$, which can be represented by $0|1$, so $L(0^*1^*) \subseteq L((0|1)^*)$. And by $a^{**} = a^*$, $L_1 = L((0^*1^*)^*) \subseteq L((0|1)^{**}) = L((0|1)^*) = L_2$

- $L_2 \subseteq L_1$

  Similarly, each unit of any strings expressed by $(0|1)^*$ is $0$ or $1$ , which can be represented by $0^*1^*$. So $L_2 = L((0|1)^*) \subseteq L((0^*1^*)^*) = L_1$

- Thus, $L_1 = L_2$

2. No. The priority of alphabet is higher than `'|'`, so the regular expression is $(ba^*)|(ab^*)$, it can recognize `"ba"` and `"ab"` respectively but not together.
